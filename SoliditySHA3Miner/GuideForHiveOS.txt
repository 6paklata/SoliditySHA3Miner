1) For NVIDIA cards, ensure CUDA 9.2 (NVIDIA driver 396) is installed
  * Selfupgrade HiveOS to latest version (0.5-76 onwards)

3) Enter Flight Sheet name of your choice

4) Inside "Setup Miner Config": 

4a) Enter the following in "Installation URL"
  https://github.com/lwYeo/SoliditySHA3Miner/releases/download/2.0.4/SoliditySHA3Miner-2.0.4.tar.gz

4b) "Miner name" will be auto populated, you may leave it as is

4c) Leave "Hash algorithm" as blank

4d) Enter the following in "Wallet and worker template"
  %WAL%

4g) Apply the Flight Sheet to the worker rig.

4h) NOTE: for the first run, it will first take up to about 5 minutes to install dependencies

4i) For rigs with older version of SoliditySHA3Miner, run the following commands in shell/terminal to upgrade SoliditySHA3Miner
  miner stop
