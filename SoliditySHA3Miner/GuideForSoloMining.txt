### How to start Solo mining using SoliditySHA3Miner

1) Ensure that you have sufficient ETH stored in your mining address (ETH is required to mint tokens).

2) Clone 0xbtcSolo.bat/0xbtcSolo.sh file and open the editor for the cloned file.

3) You only need to edit the line that starts with 'dotnet' for launch parameters.

4) Below are the following arguments that may/need to be changed :

4a) web3api=
  * To avoid connection issues, do change to your own web3 API such as your account from 'https://infura.io/', or if you have your own Geth/Parity set up.

4b) abiFile=
  * If omitted, the '0xbtc.abi' file will be used by default
  * Replace the value to the available filename that ends with '.abi' in the folder for the token you are mining.
  * If the file is not available, you can manually create a new file by and insert the data contents from etherscan.com -> {find the token you want to mine} -> Contract -> Code -> Contract ABI.

4c) contract=
  * If omitted, 0xBTC contract address will be used by default.
  * Replace the value with the following address if you are mining a different token (case-sensitive):

	0xBTC    0xB6eD7644C69416d67B522e20bC294A9a9B405B31
	0xBCH    0xe5b9746dfCC2eF1054D47A451A77bb5f390c468d
	0xCATE   0x8F7DbF90E71285552a687097220E1035C2e87639
	0xLTC    0x33D99EFc0C3cC4F93dA6931EC2CCcF19Ca874b6D
	0xGOLD   0x291DE53a16b76dfE28551Fd3335225F506dB8b82
	ATA      0xd72F60b2E7649bBC5835d25e30Ef917f04D9131c
	KIWI     0x2BF91c18Cd4AE9C2f2858ef9FE518180F7B5096D
	SKO      0xb3Dc3C839a02134f9932CbD60f3566C231cc90CC

  * If the token is not in the list above, I suggest that you might want to ask from the owner/moderator from their relavant Discord/Telegram/forums.

4d) gasToMine=
  * If omitted, 5 GWei will be used.
  * Replace the value with the amount of gas you prefer to mint a block with (decimals allowed, no alphabets).

4e) privateKey=
  * Replace the value with your own ETH private key (64 characters long excluding '0x' prefix)
  * It is your own responsibility to keep your private ETH account safe.
  * One suggestion is to create a disposable ETH mining account to mine with then transfer the tokens to your private account later.

5) Save and (run the '.bat' file)/(sh the '.sh' file) you have newly created.

### Notes

To wirthdraw your tokens, you will need ETH to perform withdrawal/transaction from your account.

There is a default of 2.0% dev fee (Once every 50th nounces: starting from 50th).
* You can set to the lowest 1.5% with 'devFee=1.5' (the formula is '(nonce mod devFee) = 0').
* Dev fee is by sending the current reward amount after the successful minted block, using the same gas fee as provided in 'gasToMine'.

Please feedback your results and suggestions so that I can improve the miner. 
You can either add an issue in the repository, or find me in discord (Amano7). 

Thanks for trying out this miner!
